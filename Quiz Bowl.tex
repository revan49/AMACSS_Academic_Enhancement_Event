\begin{document}

\begin{lstlisting}
def randomFunc(A):
	''' (List of ints) -> int
	Does something with the list of numbers A.
	'''
	x = 0
	if len(A) != 0:
		x += A[0] + randomFunc(A[1:])
	return x 
\end{lstlisting}


1. Given the function randomFunc(), what does randomFunc([1,2,3,4,5]) return?\\


2. Sort the following functions (of positive integer n) in big-Oh order. I.e., write them in an order so that each function is in big-Oh of the one immediately after it. If functions are big-Oh of each other, then group them together using ?==?.
For example, given three functions f1, f2 and f3 such that f1 ? O(f2) and f2 ? O(f1) and f1, f2 ? O(f3),
we would order them f1 == f2, f3.\\

$12, 3n^3, n^2+log(n), 30, log(n^2), 2^n+3log(n)$\\
\\
3. Question: Code heapify for a priority heap and find the complexity. \\
Hint: What is the height of a compact tree?\\
Hint: The index of the left child of the node at index i is 2i+1.\\
Hint: The index of the right child of the node at index i is 2i+2.\\
Hint: The index of the parent of the node at index i is (i-1)//2. [Integer division]\\
