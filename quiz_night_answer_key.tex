This is where you put your answers for you questions. 

Answers for CSCA48:

Question 1: 15

Question 2: 12 == 30, log(n^2), n^2+log(n), 2^n+3log(n), 3n^3

Question 3:

def heapify(A, i, size):
	max = i
	if ((2i+1) <= size and A[2i+1] > A[i]):
		max = 2i+1
	if ((2i+2) <= size and A[2i+2] > A[max]):
		max = 2i+2
	if ( max != i ):
		# swap A[i] and A[max]
		temp = A[max]
		A[max] = A[i]
		A[i] = temp
		# recursively call heapify
		heapify(A, max, size)

Complexity:
We know that a heap is represented by a compact tree that has the height of floor(lgn)+1.
Therefore, the Big-Oh is O(lg(n)).
